                        <p>The Dumbledore's Army (DA) is a secret student organization led by Harry Potter to teach defensive magic to students.

They learn how to produce a Patronus Charm to protect themselves from Dementors, practice disarming spells like Expelliarmus, and learn how to protect themselves and others in dangerous situations. The club operates secretly and serves as a vital support system for students facing the dark times at Hogwarts.</p>
                        <p>Current Activity: The DA is organizing a special training session on advanced defensive techniques to counter dark curses and jinxes. All students with a basic knowledge of defensive spells are welcome to join and improve their skills in a safe and controlled environment.</p>
